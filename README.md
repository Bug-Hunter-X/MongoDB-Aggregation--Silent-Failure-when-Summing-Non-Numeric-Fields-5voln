# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Silent Summation of Non-Numeric Fields

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in MongoDB aggregations: silently summing string fields as if they were numbers.  The aggregation pipeline appears to function correctly, but produces incorrect results due to type mismatch.  The solution involves data validation and robust type handling.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is within the `$sum` operator. If the field being summed contains strings, the operator will perform string concatenation rather than numerical addition, resulting in incorrect aggregation results. This behavior is often unexpected and can be difficult to diagnose. 

## Solution
The solution focuses on pre-processing the data to ensure the fields being summed are numeric. This can be achieved through data validation or using operators within the aggregation pipeline itself to filter out non-numeric values.
